# 📰 News Topic Classifier & Text Analyzer
---

This project is a powerful News Topic Classifier that automatically categorizes news articles into one of four topics:
🌎 World , 🏅 Sports , 💼 Business and 🔬 Science/Technology

  Built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression classifier (achieving 91% accuracy), the project features a modern, interactive web app built and deployed with Streamlit Community Cloud.

## ✨ Features:

🤖 Automatic Topic Classification using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF

💻 Interactive Web App: User-friendly, visually appealing, and easy to use

📊 Model Confidence Visualization: See prediction probabilities for each topic

📈 Text Analytics: Get word count, unique words, top keywords, and more

🧹 Preprocessing Transparency: View how your text is cleaned before prediction

📝 Sample Inputs: Try out the app with real-world news examples
